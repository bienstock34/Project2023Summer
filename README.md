Project while learning about Battery DT technology for EV

(1) Project entails the process of converting a **JPEG image** file to a **GCODE file** which can be sent to the CubiioShield2 Laser engraver.
The project involves opening the JPEG file followed by two main portions: edge detection, and GCODE generation.
These two portions can be broken up further into modules, involving:

EDGE DETECTION:
1) File reading
2) Color to grayscale
3) Binarization
4) Edge Detection
GCODE GENERATION:
5) Contour Generation
6) Contour Filtering
7) GCODE command generation
